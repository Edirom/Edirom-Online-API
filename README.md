# Edirom Online API

The Edirom Online API is the description of the [Edirom Online Backend](https://github.com/Edirom/Edirom-Online-Backend) which in conjunction with the [Edirom Online Frontend](https://github.com/Edirom/Edirom-Online-Frontend) is used for the presentation and analysis of critical musical editions. The present API version describes the backend version [Edirom Online Backend v1.0.1](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15294819) in OpenAPI v3.0.1 format.

Any frontend implementation for the Edirom Online should adhere to this API specification until there is a newer version available.

This work is based on the efforts of the Edirom Online community. Further information about the community and the software is also available at https://github.com/Edirom/Edirom-Online
